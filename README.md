# NGEN Web Manager

A web-based tool for managing files on the [Spektro Audio NGEN](https://spektroaudio.com/ngen).

This project provides a simple, browser-based interface to manage files on an NGEN's internal memory and microSD card that connects directly to the hardware using the Web Serial API.

### âœ… Requirements

To use the web manager, the following are required:

* A Spektro Audio NGEN running **firmware v1.4 or newer**.
* A browser that supports the Web Serial API (such as **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge**).
* Linux Users: add your username to the **dialout** group (```sudo usermod -a -G dialout USERNAME```)

### ðŸ”§ How It Works

This is a [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) application that uses [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/) for its user interface. It communicates with the NGEN hardware by sending and receiving serial commands directly through the browser. All file operations are handled using NGEN's native command set.
